# RainCoin - Source Code

This is a game created in python using the pygame library alongside with my 2d game engine/framework [tleng2](https://github.com/tl-ecosystem/tleng)

## Game Objective

The objective of the game is simple, you just need to get as many coins as possible, while time progresses the coins start to get faster and faster.

## Known bug:

There is a known bug for the coins, their rectangle-hitbox gets displaced from the image in a weird way.

I am unsure if I am going to fix this. You are free to contribute a solution (to debug the issue you can enable the outline/hitbox of coins).
